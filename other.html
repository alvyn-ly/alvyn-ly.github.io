			Built in Unity, Wump is an early attempt at breaking into a taste of game development with the intent of a start-to-finish product that has a full game cycle. Done in the Unity development environment and coded in C#, the development of Wump allowed the exploration of Unity’s multistage ‘Scene’ based development. Unity’s slightly modified Model View Controller layout made development extremely clean and shifted coding difficulty to primarily actual game system and interaction coding, with a far reduced emphasis on file/resource management.

			Completed in the span of 3 months, Wump was developed into a skill based puzzle shooter that leveraged ease of learning and potential of high skill play into a tight package.

			As a major event held yearly at San Jose State University, the Silicon Valley Innovation Challenge is a place for students to present their innovative ideas to the world in an attempt to appeal to a board of judges and gain funding for their endeavors.

			As a part of the Software Support Team, I was tasked with developing a software solution to their paper-based interview/judging process. Using a mixture of Qualtrics integration with a custom build CSV Interpreter built entirely in Java, we were able to develop a solution that imitated their paper process, but brought an array of benefits to the process. Using SJSU’s IT Department to rent out iPads, our online judging platform increased the judges’ form filling speed and accuracy, and most importantly, brought their 3-4 hour manual data processing time to nearly zero.
